                <h3>Gifts</h3>
                <p>Gifts aren't necessary or expected, we are so happy that you are taking the time to come and celebrate with us. However, if you would like to give a gift then we would greatly appreciate a financial contribution towards our honeymoon. Alternatively, since we know the wedding will pass by quickly we would love an invitation over for dinner or tea to spend more time with you after the event.</p>

                    <h3>Dress Code</h3>
                    <p>Whatever makes you most comfortable! Shannon will be wearing a dress and Nate will be wearing a suit but that's because we thought that of all days, this is one that we should dress up. The only element of clothing that is required of our guests is that you wear your dancing shoes because we want you to dance! (Also, without her dancing shoes at previous weddings, Shannon would never have met Nate) </p>

                    <h3>Songs</h3>
                    <p>If you have any favorite songs that you would love to boogie to at the wedding then please send us an email (shannongo76[at]gmail.com) with your request by June 5th. We reserve final veto power over songs such as the "Macarena" and "Feliz Navidad".</p>
